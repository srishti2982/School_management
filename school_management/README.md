Index.html: This html files deal with all tags and tools required for building the website.

Style.css: As name suggests, it deals with all the styling part of the website which is undoubtedly the most important part for making the webpages in an organised way.

Grid.css: This is a file for maintaining grid, and in my project I'm taking only rowspan part from this file and might be used later on if required.

Normalize.css: When an element has different default styles in different browsers, normalize. css aims to make those styles consistent and in line with modern standards when possible.
